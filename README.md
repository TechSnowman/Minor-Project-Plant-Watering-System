# Minor-Project-Plant-Watering

This project is an automatic plant watering system designed and built during my first year of university.

The system monitors soil moisture levels using a moisture sensor and automatically controls a water pump. When the moisture level in the soil falls below a predefined threshold, the pump activates to water the plant. Once the soil moisture reaches the desired level, the pump automatically turns off.

## 🌱 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to design a simple embedded system that could:

- Continuously monitor soil moisture
- Automatically control water flow
- Prevent overwatering

This project showcases concepts in:
- Sensor integration
- Threshold-based control logic
- Hardware-software interaction

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The soil moisture sensor measures the moisture level in the soil.
2. The Arduino Grove Beginner Kit's modules reads the sensor value.
3. If the value is below a defined threshold:
   - The water pump turns ON.
4. When the moisture value reaches the desired threshold:
   - The water pump turns OFF.

This creates a simple feedback-based control system.
